If you're interested in using your own private server for use with Standard Notes, you would need to simply self-host a Standard Notes syncing server. Get started by choosing a path from the menu on the left.

If you'd like to self-host the actual Standard Notes web application, visit the [web repo on GitHub](https://github.com/standardnotes/web).
