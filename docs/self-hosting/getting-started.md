If you are interested in using your own private server for use with Standard Notes, you simply need to self-host a Standard Notes syncing server. Get started by choosing a path from the menu on the left.

If you would like to self-host the actual Standard Notes web application, visit the [repository for the web app on GitHub](https://github.com/standardnotes/web).
