We have completed three (3) security audits to date by industry-leading security firms, which cover the entirety of our ecosystem. You can review the results below.

## Client-side Protocol and Encryption Security Assessment

This audit covers the entirety of our shared client-side framework for encrypting and syncing data, and covers our usage of industry-leading algorithms like Argon2 and XChaCha20-Poly1305.

Conducted by [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/), New York, in 2020.

## Full Ecosystem Penetration Test

This extensive audit covered the entirety of our ecosystem, both client-side and server-side, with the aim of penetrating the code and executables to achieve unintended effects and discover latent vulnerabilities. We're happy to report that 100% of the issues found were promptly resolved.

Conducted by [Cure53](https://cure53.de/), Berlin, in 2020.
