## How do I install extensions once I've signed up for Extended?

Once you've signed up for Extended, you will receive an email with your Extended Activation Code. This code can also be accessed any time from [dashboard.standardnotes.com](https://dashboard.standardnotes.com/).

**To begin using your Extended benefits:**

1. Copy your _Extended Activation Code_. (It's the code that appears in the blue box with a dashed border.)
1. Using the Standard Notes web or desktop application, click **Extensions** in the lower left corner.
1. At the top of that window, you'll see Enter Your _Extended Activation Code_. In the blue box below that, paste in the code you copied earlier.
1. Press Enter or Return on your keyboard.

You are all set to begin enjoying extensions. Scroll down to browse the list of available extensions, then press **Install** next to the one you're interested in using.
