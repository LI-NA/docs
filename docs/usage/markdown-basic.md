## Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.  
Copy this into your editor to see what it renders:

```
| Tables           |      Are      |   Cool    |
| ---------------- | :-----------: | --------: |
| col 2 is         |   centered    |    \$149   |
| col 3 is         | right-aligned |    \$4.17  |
| privacy is       |    neat       |    \$2.48  |
| rows don't need to  |be pretty|     what? |
| the last line is | unnecessary   |   really?
| one more         |    row        |   Yay! ðŸ˜†
```

## Footnotes

The Markdown Basic editor supports footnotes. The footnote links do not work properly on mobile. Copy this into your note to see how they're used:

```md
You can create footnote references that are short[^1] or long.[^2]
You can also create them inline.^[which may be easier,
since you don't need to pick an identifier and move down to type the note]
The footnotes are automatically numbered at the bottom of your note,
but you'll need to manually number your superscripts.
Make sure to count your variable[^variable] footnotes.[^5]

[^1]: Here's a footnote.
[^2]: Hereâ€™s a footnote with multiple blocks.

  Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they belong to the previous footnote.

  { eight spaces for some code }

  The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
  line. In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
  multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph wonâ€™t be part of the footnote, because it
isnâ€™t indented.

[^variable]: The variable footnote is the fourth footnote.
[^5]: This is the fifth footnote.
```
