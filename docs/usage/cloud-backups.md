## How to enable Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive backups

To enable the various cloud backup options, sign up for [Extended](https://standardnotes.com/extensions), then:

1. In the **Extensions** menu, install and open **CloudLink**.
2. Scroll to the _Third Party_ section, then click **Install** for each provider you wish to configure.

Cloud backups are performed daily at approximately midnight Central Standard Time (CST is 6 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)).

Backups are organized as calendar folders:

```
2019/
├── February/
│   ├── February 15 2019.txt
│   ├── February 16 2019.txt
│   ├── February 17 2019.txt
```

You can decrypt a backup file using the [offline instructions](https://standardnotes.com/offline).
