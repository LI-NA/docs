The Note History Action Extension saves a copy of your note on every sync. You can click an older version of your note to **Preview** it or **Restore** it as the live copy of your note.

The **Preview** may not work if your **Default Editor** is not the **Plain** Editor.

You can set the default editor as the **Plain** editor by clicking the **Editor** dropdown menu and clicking **Undefault** next to your default editor.
