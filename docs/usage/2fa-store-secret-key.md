## Where should I store my two-factor authentication secret key?

Your 2FA secret key must be stored somewhere safe in the event that you lose access to the device with which you set up 2FA for your Standard Notes account.

Typically, Standard Notes is the safe place to store your keys. However, since your secret key may be required for login, storing it in Standard Notes can be tricky.

**Here are some recommendations for storing your secret key:**

1. Store it in Standard Notes. Then, immediately download an encrypted backup of your data, and store it somewhere safe. In the event you lose your 2FA device, you can retrieve your secret key by decrypting the backup file and retrieving the key.
2. Store it in a password manager of your choice.
3. Write it down physically and store the paper somewhere safe.
