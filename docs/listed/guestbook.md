Each Listed blog comes with a guestbook, which readers can sign. A guestbook is a way for readers to leave comments on your blog, usually showing appreciation and offering encouragement.

Guestbook entries you receive are always private first, and can be made public from your blog's _Settings_. You are typically not notified when someone signs your guestbook, so you are encouraged to check your _Settings_ page occasionally for updates.

You can disable your Guestbook by checking **Disable guestbook** in _Settings_.
