Once a reader sends you a tip or donation, they are advised, but not required to, fill out your guestbook to notify you that they have made a payment.

You can add any custom payment "credential". For example, you can specify a key of "Bitcoin", and the value will be your BTC address. Or, you can specify a key of "PayPal", and the value will be your PayPal payment link.

## Delete blog
