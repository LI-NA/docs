## How do I manage my blog settings, like username and custom domain?

There are a number of options in Settings for you to customize your blog. Settings can be found from any note in the Standard Notes web or desktop application by clicking _Actions_ and then **Settings** under your blog.

### Adding Details To Your Blog

In Settings you can:

- Change your blog Username, Display Name and Bio.
- Add a link to your website or Twitter account.
- Add a URL to an image you'd like to display in the header of you blog.
- Add a URL to an image you'd like to display when generating link previews in Twitter, Slack, Facebook, etc.
