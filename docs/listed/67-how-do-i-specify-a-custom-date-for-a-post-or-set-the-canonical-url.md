You can change the date that appears on your post, or set a [canonical URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element) if you're importing a post from another location (such as Medium).

1. Use the following metadata structure at the beginning of your note:
    ```
    ---
    created_at: 2017-11-20 17:08:05
    canonical: https://mysite.com/blog/1/post-im-importing
    ---
    Your story...
    ```

2. Publish the note to your blog.
