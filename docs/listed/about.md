You can publish a public blog directly from Standard Notes using [Listed](https://listed.to). Read on to learn more about creating
your own Listed blog.

### What Are Listed Blogs?

Listed is the blogging and publishing component of Standard Notes, with every [registered author](https://listed.to/) getting their very own Listed Blog to use as a blogging platform.

It's free for everyone to post and publish their Notes from Standard Notes, with even more features available for [_Extended_](https://standardnotes.org/extensions) subscribers. It's the easiest and fastest way to publish your work to the public using Standard Notes as your content editor.

It's part of what makes Standard Notes so easy to use, yet powerful. Now, creating and contributing to your own personal blog is both easy and fast.

### Why Would I Want To Publish My Notes To The Public?

Publishing via Listed is certainly an optional activity, and you aren't required to publish any of your Notes. In fact, you can keep all your Notes private, secure, and encrypted.

For many of our users, however, publishing specifically written Notes to Listed is a great way to quickly and easily blog without any technical know-how required. For coders, writers, academics, philosophers, poets, even artists and musicians, it's a quick and painless way to share your works with others.

### Do I Need To Know Wordpress or Be A Website Guru to Use Listed?

Absolutely not. Part of Listed's power and simplicity is that by writing your Notes like you would any email, you've created your next blog post.

And, if you want your blog post to be a little fancier, you can use the easy-to-learn Markdown features, or even use a WYSIWYG editor to make your words really stand out.

With just two-clicks, you can publish that post to an already hosted and personalized blog of your very own.

### If I Publish My Notes to Listed, Are All of My Notes Public?

Listed is a self-publishing platform, and **you** are in control of what gets posted publicly and what doesn't.

Only posts you select for publishing will appear on your Listed blog. And if you decide later you no longer want a post to be public, you can also unpublish it with just two clicks and it goes back to being private and encrypted.

### Do I Have To Buy A Domain Name For My Listed Blog?

Free users will receive their own Listed blog address that's secure like https://listed.to/@yournamehere.

If you're an [_Extended_](https://standardnotes.org/extensions) subscriber, you can have your own domain name that points to your Listed blog, but it's not required. In addition, to receiving custom domain support, _Extended_ subscribers also receive a free managed SSL certificate.

The benefits to using Listed as your blogging and showcase website is that you're given a page link based on what you want to call your site, and all the hosting is taken care of for you, too.

When you use Listed, all you really have to worry about is sharing your works with the world in the easiest and simplest way possible. Leave the technical stuff to us.

### Some Might Like The Minimalist Look of Their Listed Blog, But How Do I Spruce Mine Up A Bit?

Your Listed blog supports CSS formatting, so you're welcome to change the colors, layout, even add icons to your Listed blog.

### If I Pour All My Energy Blogging On My Listed Blog, How Do I Know You'll Be Here Tomorrow? Will I Just One Day Lose All My Data?

We're people just like you and we hate seeing our favorite tools that we've come to depend on shutdown or disappear. This is why we've published our [Longevity Statement](https://standardnotes.org/longevity) to address this very question.

The short answer when it comes to Listed Blogs and Standard Notes is, _your data is **your** data, and you'll always have control and access to your data_.
