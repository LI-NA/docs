## Email Subscribers

Each Listed blog comes with a feature that allows readers to subscribe to your Listed blog. This feature helps subscribers stay up-to-date with your blog and lets you send posts directly to their inboxes. To send an email of your post to your subscribers, first [publish your post](publish.md), then click **Email Subscribers** in the same menu. Your subscribers will receive a copy of your published post with a link to the post on your blog.

## Replies and Notifications

In the [settings](./settings.md), you can set an email address for your Listed blog. The email that you set must be verified. After the email is verified, it is used as the reply-to email for your newsletters, and it receives an email notification when you have a new subscriber. To disable this feature, leave the Email box empty.

## Disable Subscribers

If you do not want to use the subscription and newsletter features on your Listed blog, open the [settings](./settings.md) for your blog, go to the **General** section, click **Disable email subscription and newsletter**, and click **Save changes**. Disabling email subscription and newsletter will remove the "Subscribe" button from the header of your blog and the "Email Subscribers" button from the Listed menu in your Standard Notes application.

## Limitations

The Email Subscribers feature does not currently offer a way to extensively customize the formatting, branding, or appearance of your newsletter. The post on your Listed blog may have custom in-line CSS, but potentially dangerous HTML, such as `<styles>` or `<script>`, is removed from newsletters for security reasons. The feature also does not offer a way to track who your subscribers are or how often they open your newsletters.
