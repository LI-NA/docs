Each Listed blog comes with an email subscription box, so that readers can subscribe to your blog and stay up to date with new posts you may publish.

When you write a new post and want to email your subscribers, choose _Actions_ in the Standard Notes web or desktop app, then choose **Email Subscribers**.

### Managing Subscribers

Standard Notes enables your email newsletter sign up by default. Whenever you publish a post to your blog, you'll see an option to **Email Subscribers** under the _Actions_ drop down.

_Settings_ has the following features you can manage:

1.  Set an email that subscribers can reply to your newsletters at. This email is also used to notify you when you have a new subscriber. To disable this feature, just leave the text box empty.

2.  Disable the subscription and newsletter features completely by checking _Disable email subscription and newsletter functionality_. This will remove the email subscription form from your blog, and also remove the "Email Subscribers" action.
