You can publish any note you've written. You might also want to create a tag in Standard Notes called _blog_ and keep your blog notes in there. It's up to you! Publishing content is easy:

1. Under _Actions_ in the note you want to publish, click **Publish to Blog** and your post will go live.
2. To edit the post, make your changes and click **Update Published Post** under _Actions_.
3. You can also unpublish the post by clicking **Unpublish**.
4. To email your subscribers, click _Actions_ and you will see an option to **Email Subscribers**.

Note that _Actions_ are only available in the Standard Notes web or desktop applications.

Each note can be published to only one Listed blog at a time. If you publish your note to one Listed blog and decide that you want to publish it to a different Listed blog, delete the post in the [Settings for your first Listed blog](/listed/settings) and publish the post to your second blog.
