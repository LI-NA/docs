## Publish

You can publish any note you've written. You might also want to create a tag in Standard Notes called _blog_ and keep your blog notes in there. It's up to you! Publishing content is easy:

1. Open the note that you want to publish.
2. Under the note's title, click **Actions**.
3. There are two ways to publish your note:
   1. Click **Publish to Blog** to immediately publish a **decrypted** copy of your note to the main page of your blog.
   2. Click **Publish to Private Link** to immediately publish a **decrypted** copy of your note to a private link.

Each note can be published to only one Listed blog at a time. If you publish your note to one Listed blog and decide that you want to publish it to a different Listed blog, delete the post in the [Settings for your first Listed blog](/listed/settings#my-posts) and publish the post to your second blog.
