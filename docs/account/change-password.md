Your account password can be changed on the web or desktop application by following these steps:

1. Select **Account** in the lower left corner.
2. Select **Change Password**.
3. Follow the prompts from there.

Note that after changing your password, you will need to sign out of all signed in devices, and sign back in with your new password.

Changing your password cannot be performed via the iOS or Android application.

Your account at the [Extended Dashboard](https://dashboard.standardnotes.org/) uses only your email for authentication and does not have a password associated with it.
