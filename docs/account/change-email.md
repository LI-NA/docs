## Sync account vs Extended account

There are two types of accounts for Standard Notes: the **Sync account** and the **Extended account**.

The **Sync account** is the account created by registering with any of the Standard Notes applications, including the web app at [app.standardnotes.org](https://app.standardnotes.org), the desktop app, and the mobile iOS and Android app. This account is used to store and sync your notes data across your devices.

The **Extended account** is the account created at the [Member Dashboard](https://dashboard.standardnotes.org) after paying for an [Extended](https://standardnotes.org/extensions) subscription and is used to manage your subscription.

The emails associated with your Sync and Extended accounts **may be different and are changed separately**:

## For your Standard Notes Sync account

Please follow the following steps to begin using a new email for your notes account:

1. In your current account, choose **Account**, then **Download Backup**.
2. Sign out of your account via **Account** > **Sign out**.
3. **Register** for a new account with the new email you would like to use.
4. After you register, open the **Account** panel, then choose **Import Backup**.
5. Select the backup file you created in the first step.

If the import process goes smoothly, then you can safely delete your old account using the [reset tool](https://standardnotes.org/reset).

## For your paid Standard Notes Extended account

1. Sign in to your [Extended dashboard](https://dashboard.standardnotes.org) by entering your current email in the right-hand column and pressing enter. You will receive a login link in your inbox.
2. Upon accessing your dashboard, select the option called "Change Email" located just under your current email address at the top of the dashboard.
